# Orla Curran Design

Orla Curran Design is a React Web Application to display artwork. It leverages JavaScript, Sass, Jest, and CI/CD pipelines, and is deployed using Vercel.  Visit the site here https://www.orlacurranart.co.uk/.

## Goals
- __Prototype Creation__: Develop a full prototype in Figma.
- __React Skills__: Improve React skills, including gaining insights on rendering by changing the background color on refresh.
- __Web Accessibility__: Focus on creating an accessible website.
- __CSS Grid__: Practice using CSS Grid for layout.
- __Best Practices__: Employ industry best practices throughout the project.

## Lessons Learned
- Learned to avoid React re-render loops using useEffect or useState by carefully considering logic.
- Realiseed the need for a more test-driven approach for future projects.
- A more simple colour palette is better for accessibility and consistency. It is important to consider accessibility from the beginning.
